# NClip-Rotate-Filter
Narrative Clip , to rotate the images stored locally based by .json file acc_data, and to trim too dark image.

Although Narrative Uploader did the great jobs to automatically rotate the image on the cloud, and even pasrsing/cal the gps data. But it's difficult to download all images from the cloud, and sometimes I don't like the cloud which trim some importandt photos just because it's too dark.
So I try to write a program which will rotate photos.
